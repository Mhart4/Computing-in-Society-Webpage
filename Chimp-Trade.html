        <h2>Chimp Trafficking</h2>
        <p>
            West and Central Africa are home to one of humanity's closest cousins. Chimpanzees. However, they don't always stay there; animal
            traffickers smuggle chimps out of their natural habitats and to be sold around the world to anyone inclined to buy one illegally.
            Trafficking has negative consequences for both the ecosystem the chimp is removed from and the chimp itself, all for financial gain
            and personal amusement. This is why there are organisations that seek to reinstate the chimps and put an end to the exotic animal
            trading networks. These anti-trafficking organisations are helped in recent years by developments in computer science.

        <h2>Facial Recognition of Chimps</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46945302">The information of this paragraph was found in this BBC article.</a>
            The old way to trace a trafficked chimp was to search around social media looking for suspicious posts that might tip off
            anti-traffickers as to the whereabouts of the chimp or leads to buyers who may be able to give information on poachers such that they
            can be brought to justice and disrupt future trafficking.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The new, nore effiecient, way is to use facial recognition.
