1. Interest of Content: Good

Chimp-Trade.HTML

Full of varied and interesting content, has links to the pages the information is taken from.

Index.HTML

Extremely barren, needs more substance

disabled.HTML

Minimal amount of content, could use more elaboration on certain subjects, and more content overall.

BCI.html

Good, could have used a tiny bit more elaboration on the subject

2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Very Good

Fairly consistent, navbar of disabled.html does not work, reasoning given in added comments to the file.
Formatting is slightly inconsistent and the colour of the index.html heading is different to that of the other pages.
Layout could be improved, indentation?

3. Quality of written presentation: Sound

Many spelling errors, a few grammar errors. 

4. Validity of HTML: Very Good

Missing meta tags in many files, backslashes for filepaths, incorrect files used for bootstrap.

All tags closed, generally good code.


5. Evidence of Collaboration Very Good.

Good balance of commits, All work done well in advance, Lacking author info completely.
