	<h1>What is a BCI?</h1>
	<!-- https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/brain-computer-interface -->
	<p>A BCI (Or Brain-Computer Interface) is a method for mapping the neurological activity of the CNS (Central Nervous System) to an artificial system which then takes decisions based on the measured CNS activity.<br>
	BCIs are sometimes referred to as BMIs (Brain-Machine Interface).</p>

	<h2>How can we use a BCI?</h2>
	<p>The potentials of BCIs have yet to be fully explored, however applications of BCIs are already emerging from research laboratories globally. <br>
	At USF (University of South Florida), the director of the Neuro-Machine Interaction Lab, Dr. Marvin Andujar, has been developing technology that allows people to create digital art by thinking about colours or shapes.<br>
	At face value, this may not seem very useful for the advancement of humanity, but the primary goal of the project is to allow people with ADHD (Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) to essentially train their focusing abilities.<br>
